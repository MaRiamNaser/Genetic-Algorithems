 -**This is a solution for the Weapon Target Problem (WTA) using Genetic Algorithm.**

You will find all the details with the attached pdf but this is a brief about the problem:

The WTA is a well-known optimization problem. Given a set of weapons of various types
and a set of targets, we want to find the optimal assignment of the weapons to the targets
in order to minimize the total expected threat coming from the targets. A target can have
more than one weapon (of the same or a different type) assigned to it. On the other hand,
a single weapon instance can only be assigned to one target.
